In this repository certain documents will be made available concerning the Movement Against Forced Psychiatry.

In the lessard-death folder, you will find an email sent by MAFP to the appointed coroner by the coroner in chief of Quebec responsible to carry a public investigation into the death of a police officer and Isaac Brouillard Lessard a defunct psychiatric survivor. You can read the official website from the government of Quebec providing information about that investigation at https://www.quebec.ca/nouvelles/actualites/details/deces-de-mme-maureen-breau-et-de-m-isaac-brouillard-lessard-la-coroner-en-chef-ordonne-une-enquete-publique-46848.

This event is traumatizing and MAFP is absolutely convinced that psychiatrists, related employees and the forced psychiatry to which Mr. Lessard was subjected to are the direct cause of the murder of Mr. Lessard.
